~~This is an aonyx-dynamic-loader app that runs within stream elements as a tts overlay.~~

This was the original version of what is now known as AonyxBuddy and AonyxBuddyVT. For archival reasons this will stay up. It's been a pleasure working on this first project, and it was a huge stepping stone in learning what I know today.

If you would like to modify the configuration for this application, you can find it in ```src/js/database/index.js``` before building. You will need to modify this before building as the whole thing is packaged together.
